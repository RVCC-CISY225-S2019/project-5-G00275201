# Project 5
## Add an Article and Contact Form

 **You are expected to read Chapter 9 of your text as preparation for this assignment. Also you must use our CSS formatting rules from the CISY 225 Style Guide.**

 **You Must Have a Perfect Project 4 Repo. Make all changes to P4 before starting this project. Your grade depends on this. If you need help, ask me for help.**

 You are going to clone the files from Project 4 into this repo.  Then you'll edit index.html and styles.css to make the required changes. You will also be creating a formspree.io account for your contact form.  

 See [Email Contact Forms by Formspree](https://test.formspree.io/ "Email Contact Forms by Formspree")


 1. Download the clone of your completed and _perfect_ Project 4 repo, or be willing to correct P5 with P4 corrections as-needed.
2. Add an article element after the section element that holds your 3 pictures. This article element needs to be inside the main element.
3. Include an h1 element giving your article a title.
4. Fill your article with **multiple paragraphs** from a content source. The content must be readable (no lorem ipsum) and approximately 1,000 words or more.
   *  You can use anything that is copyrighted by you: something you have written for this assignment, something you have written for anything else.
   *  Or, you can use old stories that are no longer under copyright. See [Lit Ipsum](https://litipsum.com/ "Lit Ipsum").
5. Add a section element with class="form-container" outside of the main element and before the footer element. Add hr elements before and after this section. Add an h1 element to title this section.
6. Add a form element with class="contact" inside the form-container section. Use the formspree example to get started.
7. Do not have the placeholder attribute since it not considered best practice for accessibility.
8. Edit the form for mobile-first design (no CSS to start).
9. Add fieldset, legend, and radio button elements to make the form look like the example. Make sure to use an HTML5 button element for your submit button.

 10. See the example:

 ![P5 Form](https://github.com/cynthiateeters/project-5/raw/master/src/p5-form.png "P5 form")

 11. Use br element tags as much as is needed to make sure each target in the form has plenty of room for touch (minimum of 44px square target).
12. Once the form in index.html matches the above with no styling, add CSS styling. Use Mozilla's tutorial for help. [Styling HTML forms
](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Styling_HTML_forms "Mozilla Tutorial")

 13. At a minimum, add styling for: 
   * font and text features 
   * box-sizing
   * legend
   * focus

 14. If you define any box sizes, make sure that to use responsive size units like percentage, rem, em. Do not use px.

 15. Validate, validate, validate and beautify before submitting.    

 16. Make sure the completed structure of the body of index.html looks like the below. (The content is purposely missing from this picture; it is only the structure.)

 17. Upload the edited index.html and styles.css files often. Make your final submits before the due date.
